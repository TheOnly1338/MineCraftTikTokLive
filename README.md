# Minecraft Plugin For TikTok Live Gifts
Minecraft Plugin To Get Tiktok Gifts Sent To A Live

## Required Before We Start:
* Python3 Installed
* Python Client: https://github.com/isaackogan/TikTokLive
* Eclipse To Compile The Jar File

## How To Setup

Alrighty starting off you need to add TikTok.java in eclipse after you have everything set up to build your plugin. (Youtube It If You Need To).<br>
Next you need to find the line I have shown in the picture below:

These are where your gifts and what they will do is located (I Was To Lazy To Use YML File For This)<br>
